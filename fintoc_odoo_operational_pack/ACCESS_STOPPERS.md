# Access Stoppers to complete external steps

I already generated all local assets and documents. To execute the remaining external actions directly, I need these accesses from you:

## 1) Fintoc internal environments
- API sandbox credentials with permission to create webhook endpoints and refunds.
- A test merchant account dedicated to Odoo plugin validation.
- Optional: dashboard/API logs access to verify webhook delivery attempts.

## 2) Odoo environment
- Access to a running Odoo 17 instance with admin rights.
- Public HTTPS domain (or tunnel) reachable by Fintoc webhook callbacks.
- Permission to install/update custom modules.

## 3) Odoo Apps publication
- Access to Fintoc publisher account on Odoo Apps.
- Permission to upload module package and store assets.

## 4) QA evidence repository
- Shared location where I can store test evidence links (screenshots/videos/reports).

## 5) Optional CI/CD
- Repo write access and CI pipeline permissions to automate packaging/tests.

Once you provide these, I can execute the external steps end-to-end and return a completed sign-off report.
